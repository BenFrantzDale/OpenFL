This directory contains a few examples that use the OpenFL API.

- `stipple` contains code to draw 2D stippled images with a Form 1/1+.
- `midi` shows how to turn your printer into a musical instrument
- `print.py` prints a single layer (from a `.flp` file)
- `image_to_laser_moves.py` turns a bitmap into a rasterized layer
- `insert_material_swaps.py` adds a pause in which you can change materials

These examples may require extra Python libraries to be installed.
